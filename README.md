# PROJECT STATEMENT
### Helping you find the right dog

According to a recent survey by the APPA, roughly 23% of dog adoptions come from a shelter. This can make knowing the breed of your dog and the considerations of your specific breed difficult. This app is designed to get you started on knowing the possible breed of dogs youâ€™re interested in as well as recommending the best fit based on your given photos and your preferences.

The initial motivation of this project was to experiment with image classification using a neural network as well as combining those results with a recommender system. The end product will hopefully guide you along your process of finding a new family member with an easy to use interface that allows you to upload photos of potential dogs you're interested in, tell us a little bit about yourself, and output recommendations.
